	help
	  Optimise for fast math functions, at the expense of accuracy.

	  Say 'y' if you need speed and can live with inaccuracies in
	  the results. Say 'n' (the default) if accuracy is of utmost
	  importance.

	  This basically uses gcc's -Ofast optimisation level, which in
	  turn is basically using gcc's -ffast-math. See the gcc manual
	  for what this means.
